# Sublime StatusMessage plugin

Glorious plugin that replaces default (ugly) sublime status bar and makes it a
bit nicer (with icons). Works great together with
[sublime-shell-status](http://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-shell-status)
plugin.


### Demo

![Notebook screenshot](https://raw.github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-status-message/master/screenshot.png)

This is sublime running on my laptop. It's always employs as much space as
possible that is why there is time (Ï‰) and battery charge (do not displayed on
screenshot) are showed in status bar panel.


### WARNING

It disable some default status messages (window-status messages) and sublimes
default status messages. In order to see all status messages you should use
keyboard hotkey.

Some icons used in status bar (e.g. battery "ðŸ”‹", search "ðŸ”Ž" or star "âœ±") will
result text padding so lowest pixel row of text (including underscores "_") will
not be visible. It is really annoying bug and if you have an workaround please
tell me it.


### Installation

automatically.
